## Outline

- ChatGPT has taken the world by storm.
- Brief paragraph about the history of ChatGPT and the impact it has had on the world
- A lot of people use it for fun. Some people use it for work, creating emails, blog posts, and countless other things.
- What most people don't realize is that it has had a huge impact on coding.
- The early adoption community within software engineering use it extensively
- What even fewer people realise is that even non-coders can use ChatGPT to code
- We'll run through three examples of the types of things you can do (two of which I have used personally)
- Example one: understanding how things work.
- Example two: automating tasks, such as sending that report to your boss every week
- Example three: cron jobs.
- Short paragraph about how there are almost endless possibilities

## Post

Have you heard of ChatGPT? If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the coolest technological innovations of the past few years. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that has taken the world by storm.

At its core, ChatGPT is an advanced AI system that can generate human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. This has made it a popular tool for everything from customer service chatbots to virtual assistants. But what most people don't realize is that ChatGPT has also had a huge impact on the world of coding.

Let's take a quick look at the history of ChatGPT and how it has influenced the world of technology. First introduced in 2020, ChatGPT quickly became a sensation. People loved chatting with this "smart" language model, and it wasn't long before businesses began to take notice. With its advanced AI capabilities, ChatGPT could generate everything from emails to blog posts, making it a valuable tool for research and analysis.

But what really sets ChatGPT apart is its impact on the world of coding. While it's certainly popular for recreational use, like chatting with a "smart" language model, it has also had significant applications in the professional world. One area where ChatGPT has particularly influenced the world of coding is in the development of "low-code" or "no-code" solutions. These platforms aim to make software development more accessible by allowing users to create applications without needing to write code. With ChatGPT, these tools can generate code based on natural language instructions, making it easier for non-coders to develop software.

So how can you use ChatGPT for coding? There are a multitude of possibilities! Here are just a few examples:

Example one: understanding how things work
With its advanced language generation capabilities, ChatGPT can be a great resource for learning about programming concepts. You can ask it to explain a particular function or method, or to give an overview of a programming language or framework. It's like having a personal tutor right at your fingertips.

Example two: automating tasks
Another way to use ChatGPT for coding is to automate repetitive tasks. For instance, you could write a natural language prompt for ChatGPT to generate a script that sends a weekly report to your boss. Once you have the script, you can schedule it to run automatically using a tool like Cron or Windows Task Scheduler.

Example three: Cron jobs
Speaking of Cron jobs, ChatGPT can also be used to generate Cron job schedules. If you're not familiar with Cron, it's a tool for scheduling and automating tasks on Unix-based systems. With ChatGPT, you can generate a natural language prompt for your desired schedule (e.g. "run this script every day at 3pm"), and then use the output to set up a Cron job.

The possibilities for using ChatGPT for coding are nearly endless. Whether you're looking to automate tasks, build simple applications, or just learn more about programming concepts, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for non-coders and coders alike.

So why not give ChatGPT a try? Whether you're a seasoned coder or a total newbie, this "smart" language model is sure to open up a world of possibilities. And who knows, you might just be surprised by what you can create.
