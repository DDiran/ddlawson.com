ChatGPT has taken the world by storm.

Launching in November 2022 (only a few months ago at the time of writing), it’s gained a mind-numbing 100 million monthly active users.

For context, the previous hyper growth champion in the consumer application space, TikTok, took nine and a half months to reach the same volume, hitting the milestone in 2020. Before that? Instagram, which took two and a half years to get there.

I can envision a future not too far from today when the next viral hit will only take a couple of weeks to reach this milestone, which is both a scary and fascinating thought for several reasons. None of which I will go into today.

Out of the millions of daily users, many people experiment with ChatGPT, trying to push it to the technical limitations of today's generative language models (a classic example being AI hallucinations). Others use it for work, crafting everything from business plans to blog posts.

But what really sets ChatGPT apart is its impact on the world of coding.

Software developers have already had a taste for how AI can impact their workflow.

GitHub Copilot, released by Microsoft in June last year, integrates into developers environments, and acts as an experienced and meteorically fast programmer sitting by their side. It will constantly give them prompts, suggestions and alternative solutions to the problems they might be facing. It will also translate their “create a nice-looking button” comment into fully functioning code. Oh, and did I mention it's also powered by OpenAI, the same company behind ChatGPT?

Well, ChatGPT takes this concept to a whole new level.

Programmers now have access to an always-available, seemingly super-intelligent chatbot which they can ask to help explain code they don't understand, debug issues that would have taken hours of research to do beforehand, and generate pretty solid starting templates for any projects they might be working on.

What many people don’t realize, though, is that ChatGPT can help you with technical and complex tasks even if you don’t know how to code.

In this article, I’ll be going over three use cases for non-technical people to use ChatGPT for work and play.

## Use Case #1: Automating menial tasks on your computer

Let’s say that every Monday morning, you email your boss Greg with the latest and greatest sales stats from your company.

Being the savvy and top-notch employee that you are, you put this report together on a Friday afternoon before heading off to Happy Hour at the local pub.

If you break down the steps involved in actually doing this on a Monday morning, you’ll quickly realize that it’s a pretty trivial and monotonous task, which also happens to be very repeatable. A perfect candidate for automation.

Let’s dive in:

1. You open finder/explorer.
2. You navigate to the folder where you store your reports.
3. You find the report. Let’s call this ‘2023-02-16 - Sales Report for Greg.xlsx’ (_because you should always use the YYYY-MM-DD date 4. format to avoid the day/month, month/day confusion that still happens in 2023 because one very influential country decided to say screw the other 194 countries in the world, I’m going to be different! /rant_)
4. You’ll probably either open the report and share it from there, right-click it and share, or just drag-and-drop it onto an email.
5. Finally, you’ll draft up the same old email to Greg (or copy and paste the template from somewhere if you’re smart) and that’s you done for that first drudgerous task on a Monday morning.

Let’s see what ChatGPT has to say about this.

Wow! You’ve just received some pretty detailed, personalized and accurate steps that you can simply follow. You follow the steps, copy-paste the prompts it gave you, and voilà. The email is sent on your behalf.

Not bad for a few minutes of work, right? If it took you 3 minutes to do this every week, that’s two and a half hours saved in a year, or just over a day of your life saved over a decade. On sending the same email, the same report, week in, week out.

A week goes by, but there’s a problem. Greg emails you asking why you sent him last weeks’ report.

Because you were just copying and pasting earlier, you failed to realize that the date was hard-coded in the Task Scheduler. The computer was just doing what it was told and sending Greg the ‘2023-02-17 - Sales Report for Greg.xlsx’

You now know that you can use something called a variable to tell the computer to just use today’s date to find the right report on a Monday morning. Thanks for elaborating on that, ChatGPT! The day is saved.

## Use Case #2: Automating not-so-menial tasks on your computer

You’ve taken your first steps in automation with ChatGPT. You feel empowered. You feel excited. Ready to take on the world.

You may start thinking… “Wait a minute, if all it took was a couple of minutes to automate this, I wonder how long it would take to automate creating the report itself?”

After all, it takes you a good couple of hours to pull the right reports from the business tools in which they reside, bring them all in together and actually work that Excel magic you do every Friday.

Back to ChatGPT.

Hmm… Python, dataframes, merging… This all seems way too complicated.

## Use Case #3: Learning how things work (including how to code)

If you haven’t already realized from the detailed explanations after every instruction above, ChatGPT not only tells you how to do the thing, but it provides just the right level of context about that thing so that you understand why.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT might not be ready to replace Search just yet, but boy can it provide you with just the right amount of hyper-contextualised information at just the right time so that you can absorb everything without the 2000 extra words of unrelated, search engine optimized fluff you’ll find on the first page of Google these days.

That’s one of the benefits of large language models. Because they’ve scoured through a large swathe of human knowledge, they’re excellent at cutting out the noise and getting to the point of what you need to know or do. Kind of like an expensive consultant.
