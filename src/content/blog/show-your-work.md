After reading Austin Kleon’s brilliant novel “Show your Work” I’ve been itching to get this website released.

If you’re not familiar, his book is a reflection of how much we have to gain as individuals, and as a society, by sharing what we create our fellow human beings.

It’s also about how we have just as much, if not more, to lose by keeping our work to ourselves.

Each and every one of us has something to bring to the table. Whether it’s the result of the unique way in which we experienced life during our upbringing, or simply the seemingly random way our neuron’s decided to fire and wire at birth, we each experience life through a different lens.

It's true that when we put our work out there in the open, we allow ourselves to be vulnerable and exposed.
But we also might just attract some people who appreciate our unique perspective.

And as we continue to share, and to create, we start to carve out a space for ourselves in the world. We start to discover who we are, and what we’re capable of.

And that’s where things get interesting.

Careful and considered It’s a process that’s beautifully summed up in Kleon’s book, as well as his prequel “Steal Your Work”.

He argues that all work is ultimately stolen by apprentices who are trying to replicate the work of the “heroes” that they admire.

And in the process of trying to replicate, they fail. But in that failure, they discover something even more valuable: their own identity, their own sense of self-worth. They understand where they shine, and where they fall short compared to their peers.

For me, this idea hits home. It’s something I can relate to on a personal level, and I’m sure many of you can too.

In fact, it’s something that’s inspired the creation of this very website. Another piece of content that I came across recently is an article called “The Release Ratio” by Lawrence Yeo from MoreToThat.

In it, Yeo argues that we should all be mindful of the content that we consume, versus the content that we produce.

As someone who’s spent their whole life consuming content, this really struck a chord with me.

Don’t get me wrong – I’ve learned a lot from the things I’ve consumed. And a lot of what I’ve learned, I’ve put into practice in my daily life.

But there’s a whole other aspect of things – my own interpretation of what I’ve learned – that I’ve never put into practice at all. And that’s something I’m finally changing, starting right here, right now.
