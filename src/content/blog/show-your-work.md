After reading [Austin Kleon’s brilliant novel “Show your Work”](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) I’ve been itching to get this website out in the open.

If you’re not familiar, his book is a reflection of how much we have to gain as both individuals and as a society by sharing what we create with our fellow human beings.

It’s also about how we have just as much, if not more, to lose by keeping our work to ourselves.

Each and every one of us has something to bring to the table. Whether it’s because of the unique circumstances in which we were raised, or the seemingly random way our neurons decided to fire and wire at birth, we all have a unique take on things which, when shared, can potentially inform or inspire others.

While it’s true that when we put our work out in the open, we allow ourselves to be vulnerable and exposed, we might also attract some people who can potentially learn from or appreciate our unique perspective.

And that’s where things get interesting.

Careful and considered creation that is published online is a process that’s beautifully summed up in Kleon’s book, as well as his prequel “Steal Your Work”.

He argues that all work is ultimately stolen by apprentices who are trying to replicate the work of the “heroes” that they admire.

In the process of trying to replicate, they typically fail. But in that failure, they discover something even more valuable: their own unique approach to the work.

They understand where they shine, and where they fall short compared to their heroes and their peers.

For me, this idea hits home. It’s something I can relate to on a fundamental level, and I’m sure many of you can too.

It’s an idea that has inspired the creation of this website.

Well, in all honestly, it's not just this idea.

There’s another brilliant piece of content that I came across recently — [an article called “The Release Ratio” by Lawrence Yeo](https://moretothat.com/release-ratio/).

If you’re a constant consumer of educational and informative content, like myself, I’d go as far as to call this a mandatory read (don't worry, it won't take you more than ten minutes).

As someone who has spent my entire life consuming content, seeing this diagram sum up my personal Release Ratio (the rate of creating content around what we learn VS releasing our own) struck a cord:

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve learned a lot from the content that I’ve consumed. And many of the things I’ve learned, I’ve put into practice in my daily life through my work and my own personal development.

But there’s a whole other aspect of this process which I have so far neglected; sharing the interpretation, the implementation, the successes, and the failures.

Well, if you are reading this, I guess it's time to update the chart:

_Release Ratio: 0.01_
