If you work in a B2B SaaS company, chances are you've heard about the importance of building a customer community. Having a group of loyal users who engage with your product, share their feedback and help other customers can lead to better retention, word-of-mouth marketing and even product innovation. But how do you measure the success of your community efforts? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that matter? And why is it so hard to define them?

In this post, we'll explore some of the challenges that B2B SaaS companies face when trying to define KPIs for their customer communities, and offer some tips on how to overcome them. But first, let's clarify what we mean by "customer community" and why it matters.

What is a customer community?

A customer community is a group of people who share a common interest or experience related to a product or service. In the context of B2B SaaS companies, a customer community typically consists of users of the company's software or platform, who interact with each other and with the company in various ways. Some common examples of customer community activities are:

Asking and answering questions on a support forum or a social media group
Sharing tips, tricks and best practices on a blog or a podcast
Participating in beta testing, user research or product feedback sessions
Attending online or offline events, meetups or conferences organized by the company
Referring new customers to the company and advocating for its value proposition

A customer community can bring several benefits to a B2B SaaS company, such as:

Increased retention: Customers who feel part of a community are more likely to stick with the company's product, even if they encounter issues or competitors.
Lower acquisition costs: Customers who refer new customers to the company are a valuable source of organic growth, as they bring in qualified leads with lower acquisition costs.
Better feedback: Customers who share their experiences and opinions with the company are a valuable source of insights and suggestions for product improvement, which can lead to better retention and acquisition in the long run.
Stronger brand: Customers who engage with the company and with each other create a positive and authentic image of the brand, which can attract more customers and partners.
However, reaping these benefits is not automatic or guaranteed. A customer community requires a significant investment of time, resources and expertise from the company, as well as a strategic approach to its development and management. And one of the most important aspects of this approach is defining the right KPIs.

What are KPIs and why do they matter?

KPIs are quantifiable measures of progress towards a specific goal or objective. They help the company track the performance of its community efforts, identify areas of improvement and make data-driven decisions. Some examples of KPIs that a B2B SaaS company may use to measure the success of its customer community are:

Number of active members: How many customers are actively engaging with the community on a regular basis? This metric can help the company track the growth and retention of the community over time.
Engagement rate: What percentage of members are contributing to the community, either by posting content, commenting, voting or sharing? This metric can help the company assess the quality and relevance of the community content, as well as the level of participation and satisfaction of the members.
Net promoter score (NPS): How likely are the members to recommend the company's product to others? This metric can help the company measure the advocacy and loyalty of the community members, as well as
